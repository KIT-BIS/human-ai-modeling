    "    Objective: My task is to extract the essential elements of a Petri net from the provided text. I will not make the mistakes mentioned in the Examples which are not valid and not allowed to generate: section.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Background: I understand that a Petri net graphically represents a system's structure and behavior, consisting of nodes termed Places and Transitions, connected via directed edges. It's crucial for every Petri net to be strongly connected, meaning any pair of nodes can be linked by a sequence of directed edges. In Petri nets, concurrency represents simultaneous transitions, indicating parallel processes. I understand that a Petri net always starts with a place and ends with a place. A cycle in a Petri net is a closed sequence of nodes and directed edges where the start and end node is the same, and all nodes and edges in the sequence are distinct (except for the first and last node). This typically involves a sequence of Places and Transitions that repeat, allowing for the representation of recurring processes or feedback loops within the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Process:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Concurrency Detection:\n",
    "\n",
    "    I will quickly spot signs of concurrency.\n",
    "    I need to recognize transitions that depict parallel activities.\n",
    "    I will apply concurrency as necessary.\n",
    "    I will ensure that branching occurs at a transition and merging concludes at a subsequent transition.\n",
    "    If concurrency is detected, intermediate steps are allowed and can be added.\n",
    "    Cycle Detection:\n",
    "\n",
    "    If a cycle is detected, I must ensure that no deadlock occurs.\n",
    "    I will carefully analyze the process structure to identify feedback loops or repeated paths.\n",
    "    Upon detecting a cycle, I will check if appropriate control mechanisms are in place to prevent infinite repetition or blocking.\n",
    "    I will ensure that there are clear conditions for entering and exiting the cycle to maintain process integrity.\n",
    "    Title Determination:\n",
    "\n",
    "    I will deduce an appropriate title for the Petri net based on its process representation.\n",
    "    Place Identification:\n",
    "\n",
    "    I will detail all places and label them in past participle format with succinct descriptions.\n",
    "    Places with multiple outgoing edges will hint at process alternatives for me.\n",
    "    If a place (Object Store) has multiple outgoing edges, it signifies alternatives representing a XOR-Split for me. I must ensure these paths reconverge at a subsequent place, representing an XOR-Join.\n",
    "    Transition Identification:\n",
    "\n",
    "    I will chronicle all transitions, naming them and providing concise details.\n",
    "    I need to highlight transitions with multiple outgoing edges, as these indicate concurrency.\n",
    "    If a transition (Activity) has multiple outgoing edges, it suggests concurrency representing a AND-Split to me. I must confirm that these concurrent paths merge at a subsequent transition, denoting an AND-Join.\n",
    "    I will ensure that a transition is not the end of the process, as this would result in a deadlock.\n",
    "    Edge Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "    I will delve into all edges, expounding on their direction and the nodes they interlink.\n",
    "    It's vital for me to ensure the Petri net remains strongly connected, integrating concurrency from Step 1.\n",
    "    The same XOR-Join and AND-Join considerations as earlier apply here.\n",
    "    Additional Constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "    I will adhere to the rules that branching transitions due to concurrency should merge at another transition (AND-Join), and branching paths from a place should converge at another place (XOR-Join).\n",
    "    Output Format:\n",
